# Avoid the circles

The idea I have to extend this to a game

Drag a circle from one end of the screen to the other but you have to avoid the other circles.

Lots of ideas and variables and ranges within even 1 idea

Different patterns of circle movement
Diff circle sizes, speed, etc for levels and difficulty
Color themes for levels

### MVP:

Drag circle from left side of the screen, to the right side to beat level.
Hitting another circle and you lose.

### Ideas

- One level all the balls start still except introduce one to set the rest off.

TODO:

- Player can cheat right now by hitting the edge
