Description:
Drag circle from left side of the screen, to the right side to beat level. Hitting another circle and you lose.

Ideas:

- Color themes for levels

- One level all the balls start still except introduce one to set the rest off.

- Different patterns of circle movement.

- Diff circle sizes, speed, etc for levels and difficulty.

- Character selection based on discord avatars, characters have different abilities like more speed.

TODO:

☐ Implement option for infinite space(game edges wrap)
☐ Implement array of objects to contain settings for levels
